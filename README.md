Tip Calculator pre work assignment for CodePath course offered to TXST students


# Pre-work - *Simple Tip Calculator*

**Simple Tip Calculator** is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Zechariah Johnson**

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [ ] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!
- // I only played around with the UI to make it visible on both iPhone 7 up to iPhone 11 Pro

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I started the assignment on a friend's laptop, and continued to work on the project at the Alkek computer lab. When transferring my old project to the computer lab computer to work on the files, I had multiple compatibility issues with XCode amd getting my project to open -- I had to enter into the project files and manually change the compatibility setting, as well as change a few dependencies.

I ended up scrapping this and literally re-doing the entire project at the Alkek computer lab, as I (rightfully) assumed that re-doing the entire project would take less time than solving the compatibility issues with my old code.
